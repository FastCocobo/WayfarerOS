An Arch-based distro inspired by journey and made by cocobo1

# Development info 
This distro is being made by one person so it's Development is extremely slow, I'm not sure how well I'll be able to keep up with arch or anything

Right now there is only a live ISO, it will stay this way until I figure out how to make it fully work
the source code for the iso is available though :)

I am also terrible at this so don't expect much, there aren't any official mirrors either so update wise it's basically just arch
